# Next.js 13 Fundamentals

> [part 1]
## Next.js advantages
 1. Simplifies the app dev process
 1. Automatically optimizes the web app through :    
    + Rendering  :   
        - CSR  ( Client Side Rendering : Same as CrateReactApp client )   
        - SSR  ( Dynamic Server Rendered Data (default ): First the component is generated on the server ,then sent to the client for rendering [Good For S.E.O {Easy Crawling and Indexing by web crawlers }] . With each request to the server , a new page is generated by the server and rendered , ensuring that the content is always up to date )  
        ![Server Side Rendered](./data/pics/ssr.jpg 'server side rendered')       
        -  SSG
        [ The only difference between SSG and SSR in terms of syntax is  removing the `{cache:'no-store'}` statement , which means , you cache the page and make it static after the first page load ]  ( Good for blog posts etc..)
         ![Server Site Generation](./data/pics/ssg.jpg 'static site generation')    
        -  ISG ( It re-generates a static site template after specified amount of time , so any changes to the data in that time is reflect . ) 
        [ The syntactical difference b/w this and the previous 2 is that you define a re-validation time , after which the page will be rebuilt on the server and served as a static page ]
        ![Incremental Static Generation](./data/pics/ssg.jpg 'incremental static generation') 
    
    + Creating a new page:

        - Next.js has it's own file based routing system , each folder in the api folder becomes a route , and the folder name , the route path( so you're not dependent on some package like  React Router Dom ).
        - Eg. For creating a new page named `new-page` , jest crate a `new-page folder` and crate a file named `page.jsx` which will have the content to be displayed when we visit `http://localhost:3000/new-page`
       
        - ` Dynamic Page Routing ` - If you want to create a dynamic page using the `:pageId` , for example , then you can do that using the`[postId]` folder (A folder , with the argument name within square brackets) within the `posts` folder .
        - Sharing UI components b/w components of a folder can be achieved by creating a `layout.js` file in the folder and putting common components the same way you put in the main folders layout page
        - You can create a `loading.js` file and an `error.js` ( will have `use client` at the top, as Error components must be client components) file in the Posts folder to handle any loading or error states when posts load or error out. 
          
    + Routing :   
         
        - The `Api` folder , has the `route-name/router.js` file which defines  serverless api requests.
        
        - The serverless api architecture of next js frees us from worrying about managing the server infrastructure or  scaling the server on increased demand ( as the serverless functions scale up and down as per demand automatically )
        - You define the the api routes in the `app/api` folder , where you name a folder corresponding to the route you want eg . `users` , and then define a `router.js` file , in which you define the serverless routes
        ![Serverless Get Request](./data/pics/get.jpg 'incremental static generation') 
        ( you'll get the data at `http://localhost:3000/api/users`)
    
    + Automatic Code Splitting :    
        - Code splitting is a technique of splitting large bundles of javascript code to small , more manageable bundles that are loaded in as and when needed .
       
        - Code splitting leads to quicker load times of an app , thereby optimizing the user experience 
        
        - In create react app , you need to manually do the code splitting process


----

Setup : 

+ The `layout` file within the `app` directory is the entry point into the app.

+ Any component you render in the `layout` page will be reflected on every page of the app.

+  The  `page` represents the home page of the application. ( The page that's displayed when the app starts)

+  By default , all components in the `app` folder are server components.

+ If you want to make a page interactive ( i.e using react hooks  , or onClick() , onChange() etc... .i.e Client Side Rendered ) , then render it as client component  by adding `use client` statement at the top of the component page.

### Metadata / SEO

If you want to change the metadata , you could do it statically / dynamically by : 

   In this case , we statically render the `title` in the `head` tag
   ![Static Meta Data](./data/pics/static-metadata.jpg 'Static Meta Data') 
   
---
   In this case , we dynamically render the `title` in the `head` tag
   ![Dynamic Meta Data](./data/pics/dynamic-meta-data.jpg 'Dynamic Meta Data') 


---
 
### CSS 
 
- The `globals.css` file contains the global css properties of the entire app. This even has the `tailwind` imports to apply tailwind properties to our app.

# The `styles` folder :

This is the folder , with the `globals.css` file ,  where we define all our styles and we import it to use them in out project by importing it to our layout.jxs file at the top ` import '@styles/globals.css'` ( and change the `jsconfig.json` to)

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "paths": {
      "@*": ["./*"]  // change @/* to @*
    }
  }
}
```
The main `layout.js` page will look like the following : 

```javascript

import '@styles/globals.css'

export const metadata={
  title:"Next Demo",
  description:"Learning the basics of Next.js"
}

const RootLayout = ({children}) => {
  return (
  <html lang='en'>
    <body>
      <div className='main'>
      <div className='gradient'/>
      </div>
      <main className='app'>
        {children}
      </main>

    </body>
    </html>
  )
}

export default RootLayout

```

### The Components Folder

This folder will have all the component files (`jsx files`) you'll use throughout the project .

You can import the components into files using `@component/ComponentName` into files .

- We need to call the NavBar component within the` layout.jsx` file in the app directory , so that it's visible on all pages throughout the app

> [Part 3]

The `Nav` component is put right on top of the `{children}` in the `layout.jsx` file , as the nav component will be shared among all components in the app.

#### Creating the navigation bar component with `next-auth Google OAuth`

[Source Code for Nav](./components/Nav.jsx 'nav component')

The `Nav` component will be a client component , as we will be using `state hooks` for `auth`


##### Steps For Next/OAuth : 

[ Log out Flow ]:

1. Mock the users being already logged in by  defining a useState property `isUserLoggedIn`  and set it's state to `true`

1. Create a similar fragment for when the user is not logged in with a sign-out button , which has and `onClick = {signOut}`, where the `signOut` function comes from `next-auth/react`

1. In the fragment that holds the signout button , use a next `Link` component , for the  the profile , containing a Next `Image` component, which  would conditionally render logged in persons pic/name . ( for the time being , you could use a dummy pic for the profile pic , till it's actually downloaded later)

---

[ Log in Flow ]:

1. We have to use the Next.js `getProviders` component from Next for an OAuth signup.
1. Create a state for `providers`  : `const [providers,setProviders]=useState(null)`
